Requirements
============

OSX 10.4 or higher
an Intel mac
xcode

Build
=====

Launch xcode and load the project. Select the desired configuration and build.

It should be pretty straight forward, hopefully.

NoNetwork
=========

If you are using the public source package, will be able to build
the "NoNetwork" configurations only.
