    <desc>When a player hits 'double dig' on the keyboard, first "ControlDigDouble" is called in the clonk. If this is not defined or returns false and the clonk is currently walking, swimming, or digging, the function "Activate" is called in the first contents object. If this is not defined or returns false, the engine will look for a tree to fell or a line to disconnect. If no such thing occurs, "Activate" is called in the clonk.</desc>
