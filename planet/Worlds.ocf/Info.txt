[Folder Information]
When this folder is done it should contain 12 Worlds with varying landscapes and increasing difficulty.

[Information for developers]
Worlds.ocf is a folder for settlement scenarios with a dynamic landscape (preferably Map.c landscapes).
Furthermore they have simple goals like mining or territorial expansion, and should be even fun to play
after completion. Keep in mind that with the introduction of lobby option (which will happen at some
point) we would like to introduce settings into these scenarios which the player can modify in the lobby.
Settings which come to mind are: map size, material available and difficulty of the goals. Please already 
implement these options with a static const set to the standard value, you'd prefer to be played.

If you want your scenario in this folder please add it or contact the maintainer in IRC or the forum.
