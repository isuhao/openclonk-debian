MsgTutWelcome=Welcome to the second tutorial. In this tutorial you have two clonks at your disposal, and your goal will be to reach the flag on the far right side with both clonks. At any time you can click on the guide for helpful hints; note that you can zoom in and out with F5/F6 or the mouse wheel.
MsgTutGrappleUp=The clonk is not able to jump that high; you can use the grappling hook in your inventory. Use the mouse to aim and shoot the hook into the rock at the indicated position. You can use [W] and [S] to climb the rope, and [A] and [D] to swing back and forth.
MsgTutCrewSelection=There is nothing else you can do with this clonk for the moment. To select another crew member you can either click on the clonk you want to control in the upper left corner of the screen, press [Ctrl] + the number key corresponding to the clonk, or cycle through your crew by pressing [R] or [T].
MsgTutBlowUpGold=It seems like miners left behind a wired detonator in this gold mine. Collect it and press [Use] to blow up the gold blocking your way out.
MsgTutFreeOtherClonk=Now that this clonk is free, look for a way to free your other clonk. Note that your clonk can interact with many objects, most of them containers, vehicles and buildings. You can interact with them by standing in front of them and pressing [Interact] (Space bar); also for every interactable, a clickable icon will appear on the lower side of the screen.
MsgTutCatapult=Ah! You found the catapult; it can be used to fire objects over great distances. But you will firestones to blast through the rock pillar. These can be found in the chest near the blasted gold.
MsgTutExplosivesChest=The miners left some explosives in this chest. Open it with [Interact]; the chest's contents will then appear. Click on an item to collect it into your inventory. 
MsgTutFireCatapult=Good! You have brought some ammunition. To fire an object with the catapult, click in the landscape to winch the catapult. The farer away you move the mouse cursor, the more tension you put on the catapult. Left click will shoot your left-hand item, right click your right-hand one. You need to blast through the rock over there to free your other clonk.
MsgTutGrappleSwing=Now, select your other clonk and move to the edge indicated by the arrow. Jump from there and shoot with the grappler to the granite ceiling, the other arrow. Then, use [A] and [D] to swing across the cliff.
MsgTutRopeladder=Well done! You can now use your rope ladder to help your friend up to get on this ledge. Move to the arrow and release the rope ladder by clicking to the left of your clonk. Rope ladders can be climbed just as normal walls.
MsgTutDive=To make it past the next obstacle you would need to dive. Clonks have limited breath, so you need to resurface regularly. You can resurface at the locations indicated by the arrows. In the chests under the lake explosives can be found; these are crucial for completing the tutorial.
MsgTutBlastGranite=Use the explosives, which can be found under the lake, to blast through the granite. The best location is indicated by the arrow.
MsgTutBlastedGranite=Good job! For the last hurdle you need some grappling hooks. Two per clonk, to be precise; these can be found a tunnel a little back.
MsgTutLastGrapple=Ouch! That looks like an acid lake. No chance swimming across here, the easiest way over is by alternate use of two grappling hooks. Shoot the first hook into the granite, then while scaling the rope, use the second one. Repeat this till you made your way across the acid lake.
