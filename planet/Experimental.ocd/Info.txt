Information for developers:
This folder should contain all experimental objects which may be used
throughout different scenario's. This aids object designers, cause they
may then combine new and old objects more easily, not having to move 
objects around from scenario to scenario. Please abide this rule if you 
plan to put experimental objects into the repository. Note that scenario
specific objects may still be located in their respective scenario, 
however, be sure that there will not be any reason to use them elsewhere.

Another decent thing to check before committing, are C4Script warnings
and errors. Also try to keep runtime errors at a minimum. This to prevent
other developers from having to fix objects they don't know the details 
of, in order to develop their own objects.

Finished objects may be moved to Objects.ocd, though make sure beforehand 
that these objects do not break anything. Also they shouldn't cause any
C4Script warnings or errors, or runtime errors.
