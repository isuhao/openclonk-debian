# Tutorial messages
MsgTutIntro0=Welcome to OpenClonk!
MsgTutIntro1=This is your clonk.
MsgTutIntro2=Travel through the cave to the right to complete the tutorial, your current goal is always shown in the upper right corner of the screen.
MsgTutIntro3=If at any time you need help, click on my icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Once you're done reading, click again on the icon to hide the message.
MsgTutMovement=Clonks are controlled with the WASD keys. Press [A] or [D] to make the clonk walk left or right. Pressing [W] will make the clonk jump.
MsgTutScale=Here you will need to scale the wall to advance. To scale, walk towards the wall until your clonk grabs on. Once you have grabbed on, you may scale up or down the wall by holding [W] or [S].
MsgTutHangle=To hangle, jump towards the ceiling. When your clonk grabs on, you will be able to move left or right. To release, press [S].
MsgTutSwim=Swimming is controlled simply by pressing in the direction you wish your clonk to move. While underwater make certain you resurface before your breath runs out, otherwise you will drown!
MsgTutDig=You'll need a shovel to dig through here. What's that under the water?
MsgTutTools=The shovel is now shown in your clonk's inventory on the lower left of the screen. You can use it with the left mouse button if it is in your left hand (left slot) and with the right mouse button if it is in your right hand (right slot). || Right click on the shovel in your inventory slot to get a brief description on how it works.
MsgTutChest=You'll need to make a loam bridge to cross this obstacle. In the chest there is a chunk of loam. Go in front of the chest and press [Space] to open the chest. Once the chest's contents appear, you can click the left or right mouse button to collect items into your inventory. ||By clicking the left or right mouse button, the item from the chest will be swapped with whatever is in that hand.
MsgTutLoam=Hold down the mouse button to build a loam bridge. Building a loam bridge works like digging with the shovel, only that you don't dig a tunnel but build a bridge out of loam.
MsgTutFlint=Oh, what's this? The cave's exit has been blocked with solid rock. You can't dig through solid rock with the shovel. In the chest are firestones which explode on impact. Collect them and throw them onto the wall to blow a hole into it (aim and throw with the mouse). To collect both, you'll want to put your shovel into your backpack. ||To access your backpack, press [Q]. From this menu, you can store and swap items in the backpack.
