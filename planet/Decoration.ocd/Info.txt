[Folder Information]
This folder contains objects with decorative purposes only. 

[Information for developers]
In this folder you should add objects which have a decorative purpose, this does not mean they cannot have 
any interactions whatsoever. However, these objects do not play any role in the normal Objects.ocd and do
not depend on any other objects (under ideal circumstances). Please make sure you give your object a unique
identifier and place it in the most fitting sub folder of Decoration.ocd or create a new sub folder if 
there is need for that. 

If you want to contribute to this folder feel free to do so and in case of questions contact the maintainer
in IRC or the forum.
